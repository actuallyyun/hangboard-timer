# Hang Board Timer App

An easy-to-use hang board timer app designed to enhance climbers' training routines with any type of hang board.

## Getting Started

To use the app, simply select the amount of time you want to hang for and the amount of rest time you want between each hang. Then, press the "Start" button to begin the timer.

The app will play a sound effect to signal the start and end of each hang and rest period.

## Usage

This app is designed to be used while training with a hang board or similar climbing training equipment. Please use the app responsibly and follow proper safety protocols while training.

## Credits

The code in `main.dart` and this README were produced by ChatGPT in response to the following questions:

- "Can you code a hang board timer app using Flutter for me?"
- "Can you give me a nice README.md for the project?"

The sound effect used in the app was obtained from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/).

We would also like to thank the Flutter team and the open-source community for their contributions to the development of Flutter and its ecosystem.
